## What is this?

Govcode is an application that lists government open source projects.
The purpose is to track what is being worked on and build analytics on top of it.

## How to run it?

This application is structured as an API and a front end. The `common`, `govcode` and `govcoded` directories
hold the API code while the `front` directory holds the front end.

All the steps mentioned below assume that you cloned the repo into a local folder.

To setup the API you need to do the following:
1. Build the `govcode` tool:
```
cd govcode
go build
```
1. Get a github api key, go to https://github.com/settings/applications#personal-access-tokens and click "generate new token".
1. Set up a postgres database with a new user, password and db just for govcode.
1. Set the environment variables for the Postgres database and Github API key:
```
export GH_KEY="xxx"
export PG_CONN_STR="postgres://govcode_user:govcode_pass@127.0.0.1/govcode_db?sslmode=disable"
```
1. Migrate the database to build all the tables:
  `./govcode migrate`
1. (Optionally) Run an import to populate the DB:
  `./govcode import`

Now we have a loaded DB with the settings in the environment.

To actually run the server:
```
cd govcoded
go run main.go
```

Or use [gin](https://github.com/codegangsta/gin):
```
go get github.com/codegangsta/gin
cd govcoded
gin
```

This should start the API on port 3000. You can change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

To run the front end:
1. Install required npm packages:
```
cd front
npm install
npm install -g bower
```
1. Install the bower packages:
`bower install`
1. Run the server:
`grunt serve`
1. Go to `http://localhost:9000` on your browser

If you see an error about `compass` you might need to install the [compass ruby gem](http://compass-style.org/install/):
`gem install compass`
